# Fuzzing-app
Projekt je namijenjen za korištenje na kolegiju Sigurnost informacijskih sustava kako bi se pokazalo korištenje Fuzzinga kao načina za testiranje otpornosti aplikacije.

## Originalni zadatak:

Fuzzing is a technique used in ethical hacking to test the security and stability of software by providing random and unexpected inputs to the system. It can be used to find security vulnerabilities and bugs in software.

A student project on the topic of fuzzing can have the following practical component:

* Setting up a virtual environment: The student can set up a virtual environment using a virtualization tool such as VirtualBox or VMware to create multiple virtual machines for testing purposes.

* Choosing a target software: The student can choose a target software to test, such as a web server, a file format parser, or a network protocol.

* Installing Fuzzing tools: There are various fuzzing tools available for free, such as AFL, LibFuzzer, and Radamsa. The student can choose a tool that is best suited for the target software they are testing and install it on the virtual environment.

* Creating test cases: The student can create test cases that cover different scenarios and inputs for the target software. They can start with simple test cases and gradually increase the complexity.

* Running the Fuzzing tool: The student can run the fuzzing tool with the created test cases and monitor the results. They should look for any crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.

* Documenting results: The student should document their findings, including any security vulnerabilities or bugs that they discovered. They can also analyze the results and provide recommendations for improving the security of the target software.

* Presenting the project: Finally, the student can present their project, including the setup of the virtual environment, the choice of target software, the results of the fuzzing tests, and their analysis and recommendations.

* Enhancing the test cases: The student can enhance the test cases by including edge cases, negative test cases, and specific scenarios that the target software should handle. They can also use real-world data and inputs to test the software. 

* Automating the fuzzing process: The student can automate the fuzzing process by writing scripts to run the fuzzing tool, collect results, and analyze the results. They can also use continuous integration tools such as Jenkins to automate the process and regularly run the tests on the target software. 

* Enhancing the virtual environment: The student can enhance the virtual environment by setting up a network of virtual machines to simulate a real-world network environment. This can be used to test network protocols, such as TCP/IP, and see how the target software behaves in a network environment.

* Exploring other fuzzing techniques: The student can explore other fuzzing techniques, such as mutation-based fuzzing, grammar-based fuzzing, and generation-based fuzzing, and compare the results to see which technique is the most effective for the target software.
